# blubber

A tiny and fast web server written in C23.

## Goals

- **No dependencies:** Completely from scratch, not even `libc`
- **Fast:** Multithreaded implementation using `io_uring` for I/O multiplexing
- **Compatibility:** Decently functionalâ„¢

## Why?

Just an experiment to challenge myself. You probably shouldn't use it.
